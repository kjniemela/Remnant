			Age: 20<br>
			Gender: Non-binary<br>
			Race: Changeling<br>
			Element: None<br>
			Position: Renegade<br><br>

			Appearance: Their true form is a frail pale-skinned humanoid figure, with platinum blonde hair and white eyes. Typically appears as a gender-neutral wood elf with grey and light brown heterochromatic eyes - they think its interesting - and brown hair, typically around 5'8.<br><br>

			Personality: They are observational, determined, and patient. Pretty shy and sensitive to pain. Tends to be untrusting and non-confrontational. They sometimes feel like they don't actually have an identity. They tend to be afraid to show themselves for fear of being shunned. They are good at hiding, and experienced.<br><br>

			Backstory: He was born in Hilwahr to an elf father and a changeling mother [bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.]  His family also lives in Hilwahr. They have lived a relatively normal life, other than being shunned by some people.<br><br>

			Other: Always carries a pocket mirror. They are currently hiding in a small hamlet on the edge of Hilwahr, running a ship renting service. He flies people places in his ship.<br>
