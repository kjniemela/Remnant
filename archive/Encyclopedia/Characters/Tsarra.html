			Age: 17<br>
			Gender: Female<br>
			Race: Half-Elf<br>
			Element: Wood<br>
			Position: Renegade<br><br>

			Appearance: Tall with tan skin and long dark hair usually down but sometimes in a braid. Bright green eyes. Usually dresses in greys, blacks, and dark green.<br><br>

			Personality: She is very determined and dedicated to whatever the task at hand is. She is clever and good at sneaking around. She is not a great warrior with anything other than bending and doesn't like opening up to people.<br><br>

			Backstory: She born in Hilwahr never meant to exist. Her elf father fled to another country and left her mother to raise her. She discovered wood bending when she was a child and has mastered it as much as she could without a proper teacher. Her mother died less than a year ago and she is now trying to travel the world.<br>
