<p>The wind whipped strands of Vivi's hair free from her braid. She squinted in the afternoon light at the gentle stream not far away from the barn roof that she and Owen had climbed upon, absentmindedly tossing around a rock in the palm of her hand. Finally, she pulled her hand back and threw it, watching with satisfaction as it clattered and splashed into the river. She tossed her head to Owen with a smirk. "Two points."</p>
<p>The half-elf rolled his eyes at her as he lay on his back, gazing up at the clouds passing overhead. "<i>Two</i> points?" he asked, returning the smirk. "It's just one river. How can you tell?"</p>
<p>Vivi smiled at him. "Because it went into the river. Did you even listen to my points system?" Her friend assured her that he most certainly had not, and she laughed in response, pulling her hand back and launching another rock into the air. It missed the river.</p>
<p>Owen looked up briefly, then let his head fall back down. "I was <i>going</i> to say there was no possible way you could have missed, but I guess I stand corrected."</p>
<p>Vivi smiled as she gazed up at the sky. It was very cloudy today; white puffs drifted across the sky. The sun was only an hour till sunset. "You put way too much faith in me."</p>
<p>Owen grinned. "Always." He joined her in gazing up at the clouds. "Speaking of, what are we gonna do about dinner?"</p>
<p>Vivi put her hands behind her head. "I don't know. Find something in town, I guess." She turned her head to Owen, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.</p>
<p>Owen laughed and slowly sat up, his white curls falling down into his face. "Find something... or <i>find</i> something?" he asked, casually waving the hair out of his eyes.</p>
<p>Vivi grinned wider. "You know which," she replied, sliding down the barn roof without further explanation and landing in a haystack below it. She got up and dusted hay off her jacket, watching as Owen vaulted himself off the roof after her and landed gracefully in a crouch. He glanced up at Vivi with a smug smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Showoff," she laughed, sticking out her tongue at him.</p>
<p>The half-elf rose to his full height and dramatically took a bow. "Please. You flatter me."</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes and turned to gaze for a moment towards the town in the distance. This was Sheo Caelora, an outpost in the far south of Uyalon, the Elven Kingdom. It was the place that the two friends for the past two weeks had called home, although home for them meant nothing more than a place to sleep at. Vivi took in the scene for a moment longer; she saw some of the townspeople - most of them elves - moving to and fro in the distance, the sails of a little boat that had just laid to at the jetty by the tavern fluttering in the wind, and a lonely wagon being pulled down the dusty road. Drawing a deep breath, she turned back to face Owen.</p>
<p>"What are you hungry for?" she asked with a smirk. "And more importantly: how are we gonna get it? The <i>lawful</i> way or the more fun way?"</p>
<p>Owen sighed deeply and looked up at the sky. "I <i>would</i> go for lawful," he answered, dramatically putting a hand over his chest. "Honest. My heart says yes, but - Alas! - my purse says no."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh." Vivi shook her head and started down the road towards town. "Maybe we can go to that tavern I saw..."</p>
<p>Owen snapped out of his dramatic lamenting and sprinted a few steps to catch up to her. "You know," he said with a glint in his eyes, "I feel you're not really appreciating the... <i>deep</i> emotional anguish these decisions are putting me through."</p>
<p>Vivi glanced towards Owen, then down the road. "I'll show you deep emotional anguish..." she leapt off with one foot and started sprinting off in the direction of the town, her footsteps fast and audible, "...when you lose!" Owen stopped for a second in surprise, then broke into a grin and sprinted down the road after her.</p>
<p>She knew from the start that Owen could very much win - he had always taken the lead when they'd had to run for their lives - but she ran her fastest anyway. The half-elf quickly gained speed behind her. They got closer to a cluster of buildings; they zipped past another barn and farmhouse and then continued towards the center of town. Owen was close behind her. The roads turned from dust and gravel to stone, and soon the tavern was in view. Vivi turned her course and nearly crashed against the corner of the shambled building, breathing heavily. "I... I win," she panted, smirking at Owen as he came to a stop right behind her, barely even out of breath.</p>
<p>"Ah, hubris!" he exclaimed. "I have been... vanquished. Defeated. Beaten. Humiliated." He grinned, casually leaning back against the wall. "Now what?"</p>
<p>Vivi, still breathing heavily, straightened and marched to the door to the tavern. She grabbed onto the handle and tossed her braid to the other side of her shoulder. "Now for some fun!" she whispered, and without looking inside, yanked the door open and gestured for her friend to take the lead. Owen strutted confidently into the room but stopped dead as he saw the room filled with a group of armed men, all wearing the uniform of the notorious Uyalon Police. They all stopped their drinking to stare at the two newcomers. Vivi stopped short and blinked, but Owen simply cracked a smile and waved genially.</p>
<p>"Do we have a 'plan B'?"</p>
<hr>
<p>Approximately four minutes later, the two hastily re-emerged from the tavern, followed by shouts, curses, and a volley of gunshots. Owen grinned widely at Vivi as they sprinted down the road, completely oblivious of the bullets whizzing by his ear. "That went pretty well, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Pretty well?" Vivi snapped, flinching as another shot rang out behind them. "Tell <i>them</i> that!"</p>
<p>Owen quickly dove into an alleyway, pulling Vivi along behind him. "Personally, I don't see what their problem is," he said, quite evidently enjoying himself far too much to pay any attention to Vivi's protests. "We were getting along <i>splendidly</i>."</p>
<p>Vivi peeked around the corner, watching the policemen rush into the street, fanning out in search of them. "There goes our peace and quiet," she hissed. "We're gonna have to stay in the shadows until we can get out of Uyalon." She glared at him over her shoulder. "Which would have been much easier if you hadn't set those tincaps after us," she added under her breath. "<i>Again</i>."</p>
<p>"They're just overreacting as always," he replied, cautiously making his way further down the alley. "You know how these people are. Anything would set them off."</p>
<p>Vivi turned to follow him, occasionally glancing behind her to make sure no one was following. "You flipped the <i>table</i> on them! How did you <i>think</i> they'd react?"</p>
<p>"Ah, details." Emerging at the other end of the alley, they set off in a sprint towards the jetty. They jumped into the first ship they set their eyes on, Owen stopping briefly to untie the mooring. "Either way, what's life without a little fun now and then? You know... narrowly escaping certain death and such?"</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes. "On one hand, I can't believe you'd do this again; on the other - I'm not surprised in the slightest."</p>
<p>"You really shouldn't be," Owen said, busying himself with hoisting the sails. "Besides, it wasn't <i>just</i> for fun - you know as well as I that no true guardian of Uyalon could resist getting his grubby hands on messages from the guild. And if they're chasing guild ships all the way out here, there's a good chance they intercepted some."</p>
<p>"And how exactly does that help us?" Vivi said, grabbing a rope to help him with the sails.</p>
<p>Owen smiled smugly as the sails finally caught the wind and the ship started picking up speed down the stream. "Because <i>I</i> got my hands on their bag," he said, pulling a collection of bound-together letters out of his pocket.</p>
<p>Vivi simply blinked, knowing the futility in asking how exactly he had done this. "Of course you did."</p>
<p>Owen opened his mouth to reply but was interrupted by shouts and curses from behind him; the policemen had finally made it to the jetty - and they looked very unhappy. Gunshots rang out over the otherwise so serene waters, and Vivi jerked her body to the side as a bullet whizzed past her ear. They both threw themselves to the deck, taking cover behind the railing.</p>
<p>"Next time you need to set a bunch of tincaps after us, couldn't you snatch their <i>guns</i> as well?" Vivi sputtered, anxiously glancing over the railing. "A few inches closer and I'd be dead!" She took a deep breath. "Stupid shit like this needs to have a plan... because <i>that</i> - " she gestured in the general direction of the jetty - "was too close."</p>
<p>Owen once again seemed about to reply but suddenly collapsed in a fit of laughter. "What is it <i>now?</i>" Vivi asked, staring incredulously at the half-elf.</p>
<p>After taking a few deep breaths in a valiant but futile attempt to calm himself, Owen pointed up at the flag waving from the top of the mast - the blue and silver banner of Uyalon. "You know..." he said, wiping tears from his eyes," ...I think we stole their ship."</p>
<hr>
<p>The ship was indeed one of Uyalon's infamous police ships - or as Vivi liked to call them: tin cans. As such, it was far faster than any other ship one could find in Sheo Caelora, and Vivi wasn't very worried about the ship's previous owners catching up to them anytime soon.</p>
<p>By the time the sun started to set, they had made it to the coast, where the stream ended - and the abyss began. The ship passed quietly, almost unnoticeably, over the enchanted barrier separating the two, and soon there was no more water under them - but a dark and forbidding nothingness. As the cheerful bubbling of the stream faded to give way to an eerie silence, Owen steered the ship due east, following the coastline of the little island. After securing the tiller as well as he could, he joined Vivi at the front of the ship.</p>
<p>"We should take her to Silmah," Owen mused, looking out towards the horizon. "And if we get that far, we can start looking for a guild ship to take us to Quccazzaz."</p>
<p>Vivi sighed. "Who knows if we'll even <i>get</i> to Silmah before we've got tincaps crawling all over us again?" she mused. "I don't want to make getting shot at a habit."</p>
<p>"Me neither," Owen chuckled. "I think I'm allergic."</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes. "So was it worth it?" When Owen simply gave her a blank stare, she elaborated: "the messages? Were they worth the effort?"</p>
<p>Owen, who had evidently forgotten all about the messages, started in realization. "Oh, <i>those</i>." He picked up the bundle of paper from the deck where he had dropped it. Grinning, he untied the string keeping them together, spreading the letters across the deck. "I guess there's only one way to find out."</p>
<p>Vivi shook her head and sat down, leaning back against the railing, but suddenly something caught her eye. "That one has the guild seal on it," she said, pointing to a small roll of paper with the familiar mark of the Thieves Guild - a skull pierced by a dagger - stamped onto a small wax seal. Owen picked up the roll, chuckling.</p>
<p>"It's still sealed," he said with a smug smile. "They didn't even bother to read it yet." He sat down and, breaking the seal, began to read.</p>
<p>"Well, go ahead," Vivi prompted after Owen had squinted at the roll in the dim light for a moment. "Spit it out. What does it say?"</p>
<p>"They're using a bunch of fancy elvish words," Owen grumbled, rolling his eyes. "But it seems to be a job posting... as well as a note from Zérèn." He paused. "The <i>Onyx</i> leaves from Quccazzaz at dawn on the last day of Yalmai... and it leaves from Silmah the day before."</p>
<p>"Another job?" Vivi folded her hands behind her head and gazed off into the distance, thinking. "About time. Can we get there before they leave?"</p>
<p>"Good question," Owen said, pulling a small book out of his pocket. "According to my calculations... that should be tomorrow?" He scratched his head. "Probably? Maybe? I might have missed a day or two."</p>
<p>"It's tomorrow," Vivi reassured him, rolling her eyes. "Unlike you, I actually have a sense of time. The question is: can we get to Silmah before then?"</p>
<p>Owen glanced up at the flag waving in the wind. "There's a strong breeze from the south," he mused. "If it keeps up, we could make it." He got up, shoving the remaining letters into his pockets, and made his way back to the tiller to correct their course. "Get some rest," he said softly. "You'll need it."</p>
<p>"I'd need it less if you didn't keep finding ways to almost get us killed," she muttered, joining him at the back of the ship. She sat down against the railing and took out her tools from the small sack tied to her belt.  She had always liked tinkering with whatever knick-knacks she could get her hands on, but her latest contraption was a bit more ambitious. She had gathered parts from all over - the remains of an old flintlock pistol from Bhadh, half of an old pressure tank from the workshops of Uinas, and oddest of all: a spark-stone she had stolen from a merchant in Yaaldel. She set to work in her quest to fiddle the pieces together but found herself stopping, again and again, to glance over the railing behind them. Finally, she sighed and put down her handiwork, glancing over at Owen next to her, who was minding the tiller without a care in the world. In the gloom and silence of the dying daylight, the memory of the last hour or so replayed itself. The memory of their far too narrow escape. Of the bullets that had whizzed past her ear.</p>
<p>"Really, though," she started, as if she had been continuing a sentence, "don't piss off the people with guns... without a little more thought."</p>
<p>Owen smiled. "Please, Vivi. I've gotten by all my life without resorting to such petty measures as <i>thinking</i>, and I don't intend to start now."</p>
<p>Vivi flashed half a smile in acknowledgment, but her eyes kept their worried look. "Sure, we made it this time... But what if I were a few inches to the left, or if either of us were injured and couldn't run?" She paused. "We can't rely on sheer dumb luck every time."</p>
<p>"I don't know," Owen said, shrugging. "Why can't we? It's worked so far."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Vivi mumbled. "But it won't work every time." Having nothing more to say, she turned back to gaze over the railing into the dark nothingness below them.</p>
