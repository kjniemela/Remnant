<p>The fog had risen quickly, as it often does around the islands of Hilwahr. A brief moment of panic ensued among the crew - they all knew about the deadly Golden Fog of Hilwahr, which could turn the greatest of ships into a dead and charred husk within seconds - but Aenwyn quickly calmed them.</p>
<p>"This fog is not worth fearing," she said. "But it would make a good cover for our centaur if he were to try to slip away." She stood silent for a moment to consider her options, and the crew started to discuss among themselves until Aenwyn cut them off with a gesture. "Nina, get into the crow's nest," she ordered, pausing briefly as the gnome saluted and scurried up the mast. "And Caio, light a way to shore. We might find <i>something</i>."</p>
<p>Caio nodded and stretched out his hand, closing his eyes. He took a deep breath, and, with a slight movement of his wrist, a small flame flickered to life in the palm of his hand. Vivi looked on with an eyebrow raised - this wasn't the first time she had seen a firebender, but Caio only very rarely used his skill. Caio paused for a moment, clearly enjoying the attention of his crewmates, but then sent the fireball flying towards where he thought the shore ought to be. The fog swirled in its wake and the abyss glowed an eerie blue as the fire skirted above its surface, but after only a few seconds, it disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Evidently, however, a few seconds was enough. "A ship!" Nina cried from the top of the mast. "Not too far ahead... With the course they seemed to be holding, they'll go just by our port side in about a minute."</p>
<p>"It must be him," Myrin mumbled. "Who else would try to sail in this fog?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," Aenwyn responded, then ordered the boarding hooks to be readied - an order that the crew hurried to carry out. A hushed silence fell over the ship, only briefly broken by a faint shout from the <i>Onyx</i> - which had fallen quite a bit behind - confirming that they, too, had spotted their target.</p>
<p>Vivi stood in the bow, tensely gazing out into the grey nothingness surrounding them. This wasn't her first battle - she had fought many times on the <i>Onyx</i> whenever one of Zérèn's jobs went awry - but she still felt uneasy. She had never met a centaur before, much less fought one, and considering her and Owen's recent brush with death... She paused for a moment and sighed before finishing the thought out loud: "<i>More surprises are the last thing I need</i>."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a ship emerged from the fog in front of them. For a split second, both sides took in the scene; Vivi immediately spotted the centaur towering above everyone else, but he was not alone on the ship. An old elf dressed in a wizard's robe stood next to the great ballista mounted in the bow; he had a staff in his hand, a sword by his side, and a longbow strapped to his back. Behind him stood three young men - the youngest one was no more than a boy - and perched on the centaur's shoulder stood a little fairy. Standing just in front of the centaur, however, was someone she instantly recognized: the infamous elf assassin known as the Crow.</p>
<p>"What's <i>he</i> doing here?" wondered Myrin, who had walked up to stand next to Vivi. "I'd have figured he'd keep his distance, especially after-"</p>
<p>Vivi cast a curious glance towards Myrin, but before he could finish his sentence, Aenwyn cried out: "All right boys! Let's get to it!" and the crew let out a thunderous war cry. The centaur's crew responded in kind, and in an instant, both sides had drawn their weapons and launched themselves into the fray.</p>
<p>Vivi, too, drew her knife and boldly swung herself across the abyss, landing in a crouch on the deck of the centaur's ship. She looked up and picked out a target - the old wizard - and set off in a sprint across the deck towards him, but she found her way blocked by the boy she had seen earlier. He was armed only with a stick, but it looked heavy enough to do some damage, and Vivi preferred not to become more closely acquainted with it. She nimbly ducked under his strike and landed a left hook on his ear, causing him to stumble into the ballista, then quickly followed up with a crescent kick to his gut, sending him sprawling to the deck. Not wanting to waste any more time on him, she turned back around to look for the wizard but found to her dismay that he had retreated towards the stern of the ship, holding an old book he had pulled from goodness knows where in one hand. Deciding he was too far away to bother with, she turned to look for a new target, but she was suddenly interrupted by a gleeful cry. Spinning around, she saw its source: Kharis was standing in the middle of the deck, pointing a gun at the Crow with a malicious smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Well, look what we have here!" he snarled, his usually silent eyes glittering with an indescribable emotion. "The <i>traitor</i>."</p>
<p>The fighting around them came to a brief pause as combatants on both sides turned to watch the scene unfold. The Crow glanced around, a calm but intensely focused look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Traitor?" he mused, the faintest hint of a smile appearing on his lips. "Depends on your point of view."</p>
<p>Without warning, he slipped under his opponent's guard, slashing at him with the dagger in his right hand. Still sneering, Kharis dodged the blow and opened his mouth - most likely to ridicule the assassin for his failed attack - but he never saw the knife in his left hand. Ardreth let out a howl of rage as Kharis fell and blindly rushed in to avenge his brother; faster than the eye could follow, the Crow had pulled a black spike from his belt and let it sail through the air - and both the elf twins lay at his feet.</p>
<p>Vivi felt a jolt run through her as their bodies crumpled to the ground, but in the very next instant, the battle resumed in full force. She tore her gaze away from the fallen elves and briefly saw Aenwyn charging at the Crow with her sword lifted for the kill. The assassin drew his own sword, skillfully parrying Aenwyn's first attack - but soon, the chaos of the battle drowned out everything else. Over the din, she heard a faint but shrill "Yippee Ki-Yay!" followed by an equally shrill curse, and looking up, she spotted the fairy hurtling past her. Without really thinking, she reached out and snatched the little creature in mid-air. She was obviously intoxicated, and her attempts at resistance were enthusiastic but thoroughly uncoordinated - the impact with Vivi's hand caused her to drop her little sword, and although she wriggled, screamed, and cursed until her face turned blue, Vivi kept a firm grip on her.</p>
<p>"Release me!" the fairy squealed. "<i>Fear me!</i>" Vivi just snorted in response, making it clear that she did, in fact, not fear her, which seemed to infuriate the fairy even more. "<i>Fool!</i>" she spat, cursing like a sailor. "<i>You'll regret this!</i>"</p>
<p>"Regret what?" Vivi asked sardonically. "It's not like there's much of you to fear."</p>
<p>The fairy froze, her face radiating pure shock and indignation. "Not much to fear?!" she howled. "Try asking my body count, you twat!"</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes, not paying much attention to the fairy's continued ranting. She paused for a moment, keeping a wary eye on her surroundings as she pondered on what she should do with her little prisoner, but her thoughts were interrupted as a sudden and intense heat flared up around her head. She spun around, trying to find the source of the mysterious sensation, and found herself staring into the dark eyes of the old wizard. He was muttering the last few syllables of some ancient incantation, and his staff - to Vivi's alarm - was pointed right at her, the end of it shimmering with an eerie, blood-red glow. In a desperate attempt to break the wizard's spell, she raised her knife and lunged at him, but before she had even taken a single step, he vanished from her sight like smoke in the wind. Utterly confused, she turned around to look around the deck in search of him, but all she could see around her was smoke and shadows.</p>
<p>"<i>What sort of magic...</i>" she muttered, blinking several times and shaking her head in an attempt to regain her senses. She could still hear the shouting, the screaming, and the clashing of swords, but they seemed to have lost all meaning to her. She faintly wondered where the wizard had gone, but she didn't know why she cared. She felt herself become dizzy and took a few uncertain steps backward; she heard the clatter of the knife hitting the deck as her hands relaxed, and...</p>
<p>Vivi screamed in pain as she suddenly felt the fairy's surprisingly sharp teeth dig into her thumb. She stumbled backward in shock, tripping and falling against the railing, and instinctively flung the little creature away from her. The fairy didn't seem eager to continue her attack and simply flew away, shouting obscenities behind her, leaving Vivi lying dazed on the deck.<p></p>
<hr>
<p>Some time passed - she didn't know how long - before she finally reopened her eyes. She still felt sickeningly dizzy, and her head throbbed as if she had run it into a wall, but her vision was mostly clear, and she immediately saw that the battle had turned in their favor. The wizard's three assistants had all been subdued and disarmed, the wizard himself was struggling to hold his own against Caio's explosive onslaught, the Crow was nowhere to be seen, and the centaur was backed into the stern of the ship, outnumbered and surrounded on all sides but still defiantly holding his saber in front of him.</p>
<p>"I assume you want me to surrender?" Vivi heard him say - his voice was calm but with a hidden edge to it, and it was much deeper than she had expected.</p>
<p>"Yes, I feel that would be appropriate," replied Aenwyn, who was standing face to face with the centaur. "Will that be a problem?"</p>
<p>The centaur cast a glance towards the wizard, who had been forced to retreat and had taken refuge next to him in the stern, then towards the fairy, who was again perched on his shoulder and, to Vivi's great satisfaction, still appeared to be unarmed. "I suppose I have no choice," he muttered, giving Aenwyn a long, searching look before finally sighing and sheathing his sword.</p>
<p>"Excellent," Aenwyn said, sheathing her own sword as well. "Well then. Caio and Myrin, keep an eye on our guests... and make sure to relieve them of their armaments." The wizard and the centaur grudgingly started handing over their quite impressive load of weapons while the fairy, who had none to hand over, simply hurled insults at her captors.</p>
<p>"Imbeciles!" she hissed at them. "If I had my rapier now, you would all be stricken blind before you could capture me again! I am not to be underestimated!" She shook a fist in the air. "I am to be feared!" Clearly intending to act on her words, she threw herself towards the captain, but the centaur caught hold of her.</p>
<p>"Sarjeon, how are we holding up?" Aenwyn asked, turning her back on the wildly protesting fairy. "Any more injuries?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain," said Sarjeon with a slow nod. "Mao is rather seriously wounded in her arm, Nina has taken an arrow to the foot, and Tyrvoril seems to have been incapacitated by some sort of spell. We have taken them all back to the <i>Ajdaha</i>; Terry will take care of them."</p>
<p>Aenwyn nodded, suddenly looking very old. "Very well," she muttered. "And what of Kharis and Ardreth?"</p>
<p>"They are both dead, captain. We could do nothing."</p>
<p>"I see." Aenwyn sighed, standing on the deck and staring out into the fog for a while. Then she looked up with a start as if she had forgotten something and spun back to face Caio and Myrin. "Make sure you tie those two up!" she hollered. "Not that I think they're not men of their word, but it's not proper to have dangerous captives roaming free on deck. Whatever would Zérèn say?"</p>
<p>"I can think of a thing or two," shouted Zérèn from deep within the fog. Vivi ran over to the railing to try to spot the <i>Onyx</i>, but the fog was now so dense that the ship remained hidden until it practically bumped into the centaur's ship.</p>
<p>"About time you showed up!" Aenwyn turned to glare at her fellow captain. "You missed all the fun. You didn't chicken out on us, did you?"</p>
<p>Zérèn looked incredibly offended. "Nay, certainly not!" he insisted. "We've been covering your rears; there was a whole other ship out there who was lookin' to intercept you. We... <i>discouraged</i> them for you."</p>
<p>Aenwyn nodded, too tired to carry on with their usual banter. "Any injuries?"</p>
<p>"Nay, nothing but cuts and bruises," Zérèn replied with a dismissive gesture. "Nothing we can't han-"</p>
<p>He never got to finish his sentence. A deafening report accompanied by bright flashes came from the fog, and Vivi instinctively threw herself to the deck a split second before the frightful impact was heard and various debris sailed over her head. The crew shouted and cursed as they scrambled to defend their ship, but before even the debris had landed, a second salvo tore into the <i>Onyx</i>, and when Vivi looked up, its shattered remains were already sinking into the abyss. She heard Aenwyn screaming as she rushed to the railing, her usual calm replaced by a sudden terror.</p>
<p>"Everyone back to the ship!" she roared. "Now!"</p>
<p>The crew did not need to be told twice and set off towards the <i>Ajdaha</i> in a blind panic, but Vivi barely noticed. She simply stood where she had been standing at the railing, staring in disbelief at the last few pieces of wreckage as they slowly sunk into the abyss. She remained there, looking at where the <i>Onyx</i> had just been, until suddenly she felt someone roughly grabbing onto her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Vivi! We have to go!" Myrin shouted. "They'll be coming for the <i>Ajdaha</i> next!"</p>
<p>Vivi looked up, finally realizing what was happening at Myrin's words. But before either of them had time to react, a monstrous shadow emerged from the mist: a great warship, its deck lined with cannons and its towering masts disappearing up into the fog. Vivi instinctively backed away from the railing, cursing as she stared up at the ship in disbelief.</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> that?" she hissed. "Did they send the whole freaking <i>navy</i> after us?"</p>
<p>Myrin didn't answer. Even though he realized the odds we're impossibly against him, he drew his pistol and fired off a salvo towards the warship - its crew decided to return the favor, and Vivi and Myrin had to throw themselves to the deck as an unholy combination of bullets and arrows zipped over their heads. Vivi glanced up towards the <i>Ajdaha</i> and prepared to make a desperate run for it - she wasn't sure if it was possible - but just as she got to her feet, three figures leapt down from the deck of the warship and landed in front of her.</p>
<p>"Attention, pirates!" barked the rough-looking man who appeared to be the leader of the three, who had all drawn their pistols. "In the name of the Eskiholti Confederation - lay down your arms and surrender."</p>
