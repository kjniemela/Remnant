<p>Vivi was roused to wakefulness by the sound of conversation around her. She peered out of the hammock, gazing around the small room belowdecks they had all spent the night in, then pushed herself up and ungracefully deposited herself onto the deck. Silence fell for a moment as the other occupants of the room - the elf twins who had introduced themselves as Kharis and Ardreth - turned to cast her a surprised glance, but they did not take too much interest in her mishap and the conversation quickly resumed.</p>
<p>After rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she reached for her boots and pulled them on, watching the elves lazily for a moment before getting to her feet with a grunt. She shuffled her way out of the room, grabbing her jacket as she passed the hook it was hanging on, then made her way aforedeck to the kitchen. Owen would be there, she figured; he loved to cook - he had prepared the meals on the <i>Onyx</i> for as long as she could remember - and unless he had already made a mortal enemy of the <i>Ajdaha</i>'s own cook, the kitchen was the best place to look for him.</p>
<p>Owen was, sure enough, in the kitchen; as Vivi walked in he was enthusiastically conversing with the head cook, while at the same time scrambling far more eggs than seemed reasonable. Looking up from his task and spotting her, he raised his arm and waved.</p>
<p>"Good morning, sunshine!" he hollered, grinning widely. "How'd you sleep?"</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes in response and leaned back against the wall. "Ask me again after breakfast."</p>
<p>"You got it, chief," Owen said, saluting, then turned to look at the door behind Vivi. "Morning, Myrin!"</p>
<p>Vivi spun around, and indeed, Myrin was standing behind her in the doorway, looking as unamused as ever. "Good morning, Nerikas," he responded, without any of Owen's enthusiasm. "I figured I'd find you here."</p>
<p>Owen bowed his head and smiled. "Why, you know me too well," he chuckled. "What brings you to our humble kitchen? What dost thou seek?"</p>
<p>"Food, probably," Vivi muttered. Myrin had opened his mouth to reply, but since his goal seemed to have in fact been to get food, he simply nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Well in that case..." Owen dumped the now finished eggs onto a large tray with a flourish. "You're in luck."</p>
<p>The head cook put down his own tray, filled with what looked like some kind of biscuits, onto the table, then reached out and rang the bell mounted to the ceiling. At the sound of the bell the kitchen was suddenly flooded with people, and before Vivi really had time to process what was happening a hand had grabbed her by the shoulder and pushed her in front of Myrin into the quickly forming line of hungry buccaneers. She looked around in annoyance for a moment, searching for the hand's owner, but soon gave up and turned back to grab one of the rough wooden plates from the countertop. After she had filled her plate with a mostly random assortment of foods she made her way back into the room they had slept in, followed by Owen and Myrin, and sat down in a corner to eat in relative peace.</p>
<p>Vivi took a bite of the eggs, not waiting for the others, then paused suddenly. "What did you do to these eggs?" she asked as Owen sat down on the floor across from her, with Myrin off to the side. "I don't know how you get them this good."</p>
<p>"Quite simple, really," Owen responded, taking a bite out of his biscuit. "The secret is simply using enough cream to make any professional chef cry." He paused, chewing the biscuit thoughtfully. "That's an entirely metaphorical statement, of course."</p>
<p>"You made Terry cry?" Vivi asked, giving him a bemused look, her eyebrows raised. She had met the <i>Ajdaha</i>'s cook before, and he was not the type to waste any tears. "What did you <i>do</i> to him?"</p>
<p>Owen waved his hand dismissively. "Nothing he can't handle," he said, breaking a second biscuit in half and stacking an improbable amount of egg on top. "I think. He knows me, he really shouldn't have been surprised."</p>
<p>"I don't know, Nerikas," Myrin said, shaking his head. "You seem to keep finding ways to surprise people."</p>
<p>Vivi smiled widely. "<i>I'll</i> say," she said, looking at Myrin while gesturing vaguely towards Owen with a biscuit in her hand. "That's why he's fun to be around."</p>
<p>"Oh, I bet he is," Myrin muttered. "But sometimes he ought to be ashamed of himself."</p>
<p>Vivi gave him a smug look. "Nahh. Owen's just..." she glanced briefly at her friend, trying to find the right words. "...Owen."</p>
<p>"Just <i>Owen</i>, huh?" Myrin said, giving the half-elf a stern glare. "You really <i>should</i> be ashamed of yourself."</p>
<p>"Hey," Owen protested, holding his hands up defensively. "When in Nidvagg, do as the orcs do... or however the saying goes." He sighed, picking up his now empty plate and spinning it around thoughtfully. "I know how you feel about me and all my traveling around, but we should both just keep our thoughts to ourselves."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you should," Vivi agreed, casting Myrin a sharp look. The elf looked offended and opened his mouth to reply, but before he had a chance to, shouting broke out on deck. Vivi got to her feet with a start and took a few quick steps towards the stairs, but found her way blocked by Kharis.</p>
<p>"Exciting news," he said with a small smirk that betrayed no excitement. "We have sighted the <i>Onyx</i>."</p>
<hr>
<p>"All right, boys! You know the drill!" Aenwyn's voice rang out gleefully over the deck where the crew had assembled. "Our mission starts the moment we meet up with Z&eacute;r&egrave;n, and I want this ship ready for battle before then." She paused, smirking briefly. "Let's not give the old man a chance to say we slowed him down, you hear?"</p>
<p>The crew shouted "Aye, aye!" and cheered in agreement until Aenwyn put up her hand and called for silence.</p>
<p>"Now then. We don't know the exact nature of whatever job he has in store for us, so we will prepare <i>all</i> of our equipment... just in case." She paused for a moment, glancing up as if going through a mental checklist, then started giving out orders. "Myrin, Nina, and Morwen - make sure all pistols on board are loaded and that ammunition is available on deck... Caio, get your explosives ready... Kharis and Sergius, make sure all swords and daggers are sharp and ready for use... Ardreth, Mao, and Sarjeon - string the bows and make sure everyone has enough arrows... Tyrvoril, inspect the shields, make sure they still hold up." She hesitated for a second as everyone set out to carry out their tasks, then continued, "and Terry... you and Nerikas do whatever it is you do. I remember the last time we put your heads together, so I'll just leave you to it without asking any questions."</p>
<p>Vivi frowned thoughtfully, trying to remember what had happened last time Owen and Terry fought together, but soon gave up and looked up expectantly for a task of her own. To her surprise and disappointment, however, Aenwyn did not seem about to give any more orders but had instead turned back to the helm. She glanced at the <i>Onyx</i> on the horizon briefly but then, not content with simply submitting to boredom, turned and marched up the stairs to the helm. "Captain Aenwyn?"</p>
<p>"Well, ahoy there!" Aenwyn said with a smile and a wave. "Vivi, is it?"</p>
<p>Vivi nodded as she hopped up the last few steps. "Do you not have a task for me too?"</p>
<p>Aenwyn chuckled lightly. "Well, I need someone on deck to keep a lookout for me, don't I? These old eyes aren't as sharp as they used to be, you know." She paused, casting Vivi an apologetic glance. "I figured you'd be going back to the <i>Onyx</i>, and we both know Z&eacute;r&egrave;n would make sure you had plenty to do."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose he would." Vivi smiled despite herself, casting another glance at the ship. "We going to catch up with them soon?"</p>
<p>"I figure we'll catch them in about ten, maybe fifteen minutes, perhaps?" Aenwyn chuckled. "Impatient, are we?"</p>
<p>Vivi leaned herself back against the railing behind Aenwyn. "Aren't you?" She said lightly.</p>
<p>"Impatient?" Aenwyn made a noise that sounded like something between a laugh and a snort of indignation. "I'd like to think not. I, for one, don't miss Z&eacute;r&egrave;n <i>that</i> much."</p>
<p>Vivi gave a lighthearted chuckle, and then the smile on her lips disappeared for a second. "I guess... it's less being impatient than just... wanting things to turn out okay."</p>
<p>Aenwyn sighed, turning around to smile warmly towards Vivi. "Are you worried?"</p>
<p>Vivi exhaled through her nose and shrugged her shoulders half-heartedly. "I'm always worried when I don't know what I'm getting myself into." She paused, taking a breath. "Owen and I had too close of a call yesterday... we could both just as well be laying dead in an alley in Sheo Caelora instead of being here."</p>
<p>"Well... you're here, aren't you?" Aenwyn reached out, ruffling Vivi's hair with a slim but weathered hand. "Sure feels like it."</p>
<p>A wide smile grew on Vivi's face. "Yeah, I guess so." She chuckled, watching Aenwyn pull away. "But what if things had gone wrong?" She paused. "Bullets were whizzing around our ears... what if one was just a few inches to the left? What if I was shot? What if Owen..." She looked away - this wasn't what they usually talked about, but she had been chewing on it and somehow felt like it needed to be spoken to someone who might understand.</p>
<p>Aenwyn shrugged lightly. "Well, the simple answer is: you'd be dead." She smiled again and turned back to mind the helm. "But that's not what you were asking, was it?"</p>
<p>"No," Vivi said softly, keeping her gaze on the <i>Onyx</i>. "Just that... a few inches to the left, and everything could change."</p>
<p>"Everything always changes, dear," Aenwyn mused. She glanced back again, looking for a moment at Vivi with sad eyes. "You don't have to put yourself in front of bullets if you don't want to. I don't know what Z&eacute;r&egrave;n's drummed into your head, but on my ship, everyone has a choice."</p>
<p>Vivi chuckled lightly. "Sure, it’s a <i>choice</i>, but it seems pretty drab working for my wage in a field." She gave a sideways smirk to Aenwyn.</p>
<p>"That's the catch, isn't it?" Aenwyn replied, returning the smirk. "You know... I did consider settling down. Still do, sometimes, after a job is done. I'm not as young as I look, you know; maybe it would be nice to just take it easy..." She paused, casting Vivi an impish glance and breaking into a grin. "But where's the <i>fun</i> in that?"</p>
<p>"<i>Exactly</i>," Vivi agreed, and they shared a short laugh before it died and Vivi turned to look out at the <i>Onyx</i> once again.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Well, whaddya know, lads? Look who finally decided to show up!" Z&eacute;r&egrave;n and his crew cackled at the gibe, and Vivi, seeing Aenwyn's indignant look, could not help a chuckle of her own. The old captain of the <i>Onyx</i> hadn't changed a bit since she saw him last; his grey hair - which if anything had grown just a bit thinner - was as always draped messily over his shoulders, he was wearing the same grey overcoat as he had on the day she first saw him two years ago and which, if the rumors about it could be believed, was older than the <i>Onyx</i> herself, and his sense of humor was still, at the least, four decades out of date.</p>
<p>"You sound impatient, Z&eacute;r&egrave;n!" Aenwyn shouted back, putting a hand on her hip and rolling her eyes. "Did you miss me that much?"</p>
<p>"Nay, not on your life!" Z&eacute;r&egrave;n responded, swinging himself over the railing as the ships finally drew close enough and landed semi-gracefully on the deck in front of Aenwyn, a large part of his crew following him. "But we've spent the better part of the morning waiting for you lot. What kept you?"</p>
<p>"We were busy picking up some stragglers of yours," Aenwyn said, gesturing briefly towards Vivi. Z&eacute;r&egrave;n looked surprised for a moment, then finally turned and spotted her.</p>
<p>"Well, wouldya look at that!" he exclaimed, stepping forward to give Vivi a friendly clap on the shoulder. "Little miss Blackwood herself, huh?" He paused and looked around again for a moment. "D'you happen to bring Owen with you, or did he get lost on the way?"</p>
<p>Vivi smiled. "Oh, don't you worry. He's belowdecks with Terry."</p>
<p>The old captain shuddered at the mention of the cook's name but quickly moved on. "Now," he said, turning to Aenwyn again, "I'm sure you're <i>dying</i> to know what we have been sent here for, heh?"</p>
<p>Aenwyn, who Vivi knew would never admit how curious she was, simply cast Z&eacute;r&egrave;n an unimpressed look. "Well, spit it out."</p>
<p>"Aye," he chuckled in response, "I figured you'd say that." Reaching into the pocket of his coat, he produced a scroll and, unrolling it while casting Aenwyn a glance, began to read. "Posted by Earl Roland of E'harius: One thousand gold pieces to whoever brings in one Captain Nijem of Reykjaa, dead or alive." There was a quiet but audible gasp from the crew at the mention of such a generous reward, and Z&eacute;r&egrave;n smiled smugly.</p>
<p>"Well, what's the catch?" Ardreth spoke up from the back of the ship. "Why a thousand pieces for just one man?" The rest of the crew mumbled in agreement, and Z&eacute;r&egrave;n nodded.</p>
<p>"A fair question," he said, turning the scroll over to reveal a picture of the target: a stern-looking centaur with long golden-brown hair and green eyes. Vivi raised her eyebrows in surprise: centaurs were rare nowadays, and she had never seen one in person. "He's an Eskiholti privateer, one of the most daring ones to ever sail the abyss, they say. He and his crew have been pestering Brolzoni ships for years... Although he should have known better than to mess with the thieves guild." He paused for a moment, smiling wryly. "Not only is he himself very dangerous: a few other crews have challenged our claim to this job, so you can see my hurry to get here first. But even so, we should be prepared to have to fight for the spoils."</p>
<p>"Daring privateer or not, centaur or not, no Eskiholti is going to stop me," Aenwyn said calmly, her arms crossed. "Especially not with a thousand gold pieces at stake. And as for any crew that would come to steal our prize, I'd like to see the ship that can out-sail the <i>Ajdaha</i>."</p>
<p>"Aye, that's the spirit!" Z&eacute;r&egrave;n shouted, and the rest of the crew cheered in agreement, their confidence restored. "And now," he continued, "to the point. My source has told me he made harbor in Nar Badhir - " he pointed with a gloved hand towards the island off into the distance - "and as far as we know, he hasn't left."</p>
<p>"We'll have to be stealthy, then," Aenwyn mused. "Badhir is a big island, and most of it uninhabited. If he slips away into the forest, we may never find him again."</p>
<p>"He's a centaur," Vivi mumbled, rolling her eyes. "How hard could he be to find?"</p>
<p>Z&eacute;r&egrave;n laughed. "That's right, Miss Blackwood," he chuckled. "We'll just have to be stealthy, aye?"</p>
<p>"Stealthy and <i>quick</i>, if the situation is as urgent as you say," Aenwyn replied. "Shall we get to it?"</p>
<p>Z&eacute;r&egrave;n nodded and gestured for his own crew to return to the Onyx. Putting one hand on the railing and preparing to swing himself back to his ship, he turned around one last time to grin widely at Aenwyn. "Let's go catch ourselves a centaur!"</p>
