<p>Several hours later, Vivi started awake as the ship suddenly and forcefully banked, sending her crashing into the railing. "What the hell was that for?" she mumbled groggily, turning over to glare at Owen.</p>
<p>"Uyalon ships," Owen said briefly, pointing towards two specks on the horizon. "They've spotted us. I'm heading for land before they decide to check us out a bit more closely."</p>
<p>Vivi cursed, darting to her feet. "How far off are we?" she said, trying to get a glimpse of the coastline in the dim twilight.</p>
<p>"Six, seven miles at the most," Owen said after a moment's consideration. "We should be able to make it before the sun comes up." Vivi glanced down into the abyss, and indeed, its oppressive darkness had yielded to a faint yellow glow. The sun was starting to rise.</p>
<p>"I'm more worried about making it before we're blown to pieces," Vivi muttered, looking back up at the two ships on the horizon.</p>
<p>"A minor detail," Owen said, looking over at her with a smile. Vivi didn't return it, and they sailed on in anxious silence, Vivi keeping a vigilant eye on the ships.</p>
<p>Carried by a southerly breeze, they swiftly approached the shore. As soon as they were close enough, they jumped from the ship onto land, not bothering to moor the ship.</p>
<p>"They can keep their little boat," Owen said smugly as the ship drifted off along the coastline. "Those gentlemen down in Sheo Caelora seemed so eager to get it back. I'm sure they'll be thrilled."</p>
<p>"It could've been useful later," Vivi objected, dusting off her clothes after the hasty disembarkment. "What if we don't find the Onyx here?"</p>
<p>Owen waved her objections aside. "How likely is that to happen?"</p>
<p>"Considering the past fourteen hours, quite." She looked around, trying to figure out what to do next. "Silmah should be a few miles to the north," she mused, starting to walk as she spoke. "We'll have to hurry if we're gonna make it on time."</p>
<p>Owen joined her, walking towards the town in the distance at a brisk pace. "They might not be able to leave on time either way with those ships patrolling and all... if they even made it to shore in the first place."</p>
<p>"We'll check the docks for them," Vivi muttered. "If they're not there, we'll have to hide out somewhere until everything calms down."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Owen sighed, subtly picking up the pace. "But we should-"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a deafening gunshot rang out from behind a cluster of trees nearby. The two threw themselves to the ground instinctively, taking cover as best as they could in the underbrush.</p>
<p>"I said I didn't want to make this a habit!" Vivi hissed, cursing as she scraped her arms on the rough ground. "Now who's trying to kill us?"</p>
<p>Owen peeked out from behind their cover, trying to get a good look at their attacker. "I strongly disapprove of this!" he shouted. "How very uncivil of you to attack poor weary travelers like that!"</p>
<p>Vivi grabbed him by the back of his shirt and pulled him back onto the ground. "Get down, you idiot!" she snapped. "I don't think they care whether you approve or not!"</p>
<p>They waited tensely for another shot, but none came. Instead, they heard footsteps slowly approaching.</p>
<p>"We'll take 'im by surprise," Owen whispered, rummaging through his pockets to find some sort of weapon. "Ready?"</p>
<p>"Fine," Vivi whispered back, drawing a short knife from her belt, but before she could react further, Owen was on his feet.</p>
<p>"Stop right there, criminal scum!" he shouted, pointing his weapon at the gunman. However, what he had pulled out of his pockets was an old spoon, and the gunman in question - a scruffy young man wearing an old sailor's cap - wasn't very impressed.</p>
<p>"Easy, big guy," he sighed, holding his hands up out of pure instinct rather than out of any genuine fear. "I assumed you were someone else."</p>
<p>Owen squinted at the man suspiciously, but Vivi's face relaxed as she finally recognized him.</p>
<p>"Myrin?" she asked with a sigh of relief. "I thought you were another tincap trying to make our lives miserable."</p>
<p>"I nearly did," Myrin replied, putting the gun back in his belt. "And believe me, I still could." He gave her a crooked smile. "What are you two doing out here?"</p>
<p>"I was about to ask you the same," Owen huffed. "I suppose we weren't in any actual danger with you holding the gun, but still. What's the big idea?"</p>
<p>"I saw you disembark that ship." He pointed in the direction of the boat that was still slowly drifting away in the distance. "I assumed you were the Uyalon police. You get yourselves into trouble again?"</p>
<p>Vivi smiled. "Don't we always?" she said, getting to her feet and brushing the dirt off her bruised elbows. "How about you?"</p>
<p>Myrin sighed again. "I try my best to keep out of trouble, thank you," he said, then turned to Owen. "You still haven't answered my question, Nerikas," he said, using his elven name. "Why are you two out here?"</p>
<p>"You see... it's like this," Owen said, putting his arm over Myrin's shoulder - much to the elf's dismay - and gesturing out vaguely into the distance. "What's important isn't knowing where you've been, but where you're going."</p>
<p>"That doesn't answer my question," Myrin shot back, struggling to free himself from the unwelcome embrace. "Where are you going, then?"</p>
<p>Vivi chuckled in amusement at the elf's predicament. "Zérèn is calling the crew back together," she explained. "He says there's a new job for us. Any idea what it is?"</p>
<p>"Not a clue," Myrin grunted, finally breaking loose from Owen's grip. "All I know is that Captain Aenwyn has summoned me to join her crew."</p>
<p>"Must be a big job, then," Owen mused, putting the spoon back into his pocket. "Aenwyn and Zérèn always take those together, they have for as long as I can remember."</p>
<p>Myrin shrugged, turning to continue walking down the dusty path. "We'll see, I suppose."</p>
<p>"If we get there in time," Vivi muttered under her breath, following him down the road after giving Owen a quick glance.</p>
<p>"Of course we will," Owen replied, falling into a confident stride behind her. "What could possibly stop us?"</p>
<hr>
<p>"What could possibly stop us?" Vivi muttered, peeking out from around their cover to get another look at the group of Uyalon Police patrolling the docks of Silmah. "I'd say a dozen tincaps or so stand a decent chance." Their entry into town had gone by smoothly; Silmah was large enough that one could move about without attracting too many curious gazes, but not so large as to warrant the presence of the Uyalon Police - at least usually. Today, however, they were very much present, to Vivi's dismay.</p>
<p>"I don't see why you're surprised they're here, after you stole a ship from them," Myrin said, shaking his head.  "You practically baited them."</p>
<p>"'Stole' is a strong word," Owen protested. "I like to call it 'borrowing'. Besides, how would these guys know about that?" He glanced towards the elf and grinned. "That was way down in Sheo Caelora."</p>
<p>"I suppose word gets around fast," Myrin replied dryly. "How are you so certain they haven't tracked you here?"</p>
<p>Owen smiled. "Bold you to assume I'm ever certain about anything. But that hasn't stopped me yet."</p>
<p>"At this point, it's pretty likely they did track us here," Vivi said, rolling her eyes at Owen. "Although I didn't expect there to be so many of them."</p>
<p>Owen opened his mouth to reply, but Myrin cut him off. "Hold on," he said, squinting in the bright sunlight. "Over there... that looks an awful lot like Aenwyn's ship." He pointed at a ship docked on the far end of one of the jetties. Vivi looked around, trying to spot it, but Owen nodded after a quick glance.</p>
<p>"Could be," he mused. "You gonna find out?"</p>
<p>Myrin shook his head incredulously. "I knew you were crazy, Nerikas... but going out on that jetty is suicide. Even you ought to realize that."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," Owen replied, cracking his knuckles. "All we need is a... distraction. Ready?" Myrin tried to object that he was most certainly not ready, but Owen was already confidently strutting onto the jetty.</p>
<p>"He's insane," Myrin whispered, staring in disbelief after Owen, who had at this point grabbed the attention of every guard on the jetty with his hollering. "Not a chance he's getting out of this alive."</p>
<p>"You'd be surprised," Vivi said, her own look of disbelief giving way to a smile. "He'll get out of it... he always somehow does."</p>
<p>"If you say so," Myrin muttered. "But he did give us a distraction - let's make use of it." Not waiting for a response, he snuck his way onto the jetty, where Owen was still orating. Vivi cursed silently and tried to convince herself it was a terrible idea, but eventually gave in and followed him. They quietly approached the ship and, after swinging themselves over the railing, made their way below deck.</p>
<p>"I don't like this," Vivi muttered, looking around cautiously in the darkness and fumbling to draw her knife. "If this really is her ship, then where is everyone?"</p>
<p>Before they had any chance to react, Vivi and Myrin found themselves with a frightening number of weapons pointed at them. "We're right here, sweetie," a voice softly spoke out of the darkness. It was barely louder than a whisper, but its tone chilled Vivi to the bone. "No need to raise your voice."</p>
<p>"It's alright, Captain," Myrin replied, speaking just as softly. "It's me. What's going on?" A short pause followed, then a click and a spark, and a lantern was lit. Its flickering light illuminated several figures: a pair of elves armed with gleaming rapiers, a sorry ensemble of thugs - mostly human - carrying whatever weapon they had chanced to get their hands on, a black-haired little girl holding the lantern, and in the middle of it all, a tall, well-dressed elf; Vivi immediately recognized her as Captain Aenwyn.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the captain, sheathing her sword with a smirk. "What have you dragged in this time, Myrin?"</p>
<p>"This is Vivi Blackwood," Myrin said shortly. "And I'm not the one dragging her anywhere - that would be Nerikas."</p>
<p>"...Who is the one still out there risking his skin, by the way," Vivi interjected. Aenwyn raised her eyebrow in confusion, and Myrin hurried to explain.</p>
<p>"He created the distraction that allowed us to sneak aboard," he said. "I'm sure you heard some of it."</p>
<p>"Indeed we did," Aenwyn replied with a smile. "Rather brave of him, no?"</p>
<p>Myrin snorted. "Idiotic, if you ask me."</p>
<p>Vivi felt her patience finally run out. "Hey!" she hissed, gesturing wildly with the hand that was still holding her knife. "Brave or idiotic, he's still in danger up there! What are we gonna do about it?"</p>
<p>One of the elves spoke up. "What do you suggest we do?" he asked, pointing his sword at Vivi. "Fight off the entire harbor guard?"</p>
<p>Vivi rolled her eyes. "We snatch him aboard and make a run for it," she said, gently pushing the tip of the sword away from her. "We're on a freaking ship, aren't we? It's not like we're stuck."</p>
<p>The elf seemed about to argue back, but Aenwyn cut him off with a gesture. "If we do decide to leave, there's not all that much the harbor guard can do about it," she agreed. "We have been waiting this long to allow as much of our crew as possible to make their way here."</p>
<p>"Okay, good," Vivi said, "we've got the 'make a run for it' part down. How about the snatching?"</p>
<p>"I should go up first," Myrin offered before Aenwyn could reply. "If there is combat, we'll have an advantage in not revealing our numbers right away." The captain nodded her approval, and Myrin made his way up the stairs while Vivi, too curious to remain behind, cautiously followed him.</p>
<p>The two snuck their way onto the deck and, encouraged by the apparent lack of enemies, made their way to the railing and peeked down at the jetty. Owen - somehow - had managed to talk himself out of trouble yet again, and only a lone harbor guard remained nearby, with whom the half-elf was engaged in lively conversation.</p>
<p>"Just one?" Myrin smiled. "I can handle that." Taking a deep breath, he rose to his full height and shouted down at Owen. "Nerikas!"</p>
<p>Both Owen and the guard looked up with a start, and the latter reached for his weapon - but Myrin was much faster. In the blink of an eye, he had pulled his pistol and fired off a shot, sending the guard sprawling to the ground.</p>
<p>"Are you quite finished?" he said, holstering the gun with a smirk.</p>
<p>Owen sighed in annoyance, turning to look up at Myrin. "I guess I am now. What took you so long?"</p>
<p>Vivi glanced for a moment at the wounded guard and shuddered, but finally tore her gaze away to face Owen. "We don't have time to explain!" she shouted, looking down the jetty to see the rest of the harbor guards swarming towards them. "Just get aboard!" Owen did just that, stopping for the briefest of moments to unmoor the ship, while Myrin, joined by the rest of the crew that had emerged from belowdecks, scrambled to raise the sails.</p>
<p>"All right, boys!" Aenwyn shouted gleefully as the sails caught the wind, jerking the ship into motion. "We mustn't forget our manners; let's give these good fellows a hearty farewell!" She drew her pistol, and all those of her crew that had one did the same, sending the guards scurrying to take cover behind their shields as a thunderous salvo roared over their heads. After a brief moment of confusion, they collected themselves and returned fire, but the ship was already well on its way out of the harbor.</p>
<p>"Well, Nerikas," Aenwyn said, handing her gun to the raven-haired girl to be reloaded. "We seem to keep coming to your rescue in the nick of time, don't we?"</p>
<p>Owen flashed an innocent smile in response, but before he could speak, Vivi cut him off. "Shouldn't we be more worried about them?" she asked, pointing to the jetty where the guards were scrambling to get to their own ship. "You know, they'll be coming after us."</p>
<p>Aenwyn laughed, walking over to the helm and taking the wheel. "Not to worry," she reassured her. "The only way to catch the Ajdaha is to chase her to the end of the world."</p>
<p>"I hope that's not where we're headed, then," Owen said with a smile. "Personally, I'd prefer Quccazzaz. We can still catch the Onyx there."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we'll have to disappoint you, then," Aenwyn replied. "We're taking the western route, through the Didard strait, and we don't have time for a detour. We'll rendezvous with the Onyx south of Nar Badhir."</p>
<p>Vivi sighed, looking out across the abyss. "As long as we all get there," she muttered, watching the town fade away into the distance.</p>
