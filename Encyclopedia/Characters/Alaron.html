		<p style="font-size: 22px;">
			Age: 147<br>
			Gender: Non-binary<br>
			Race: Sun Elf<br>
			Element: Fire<br>
			Position: Renegade<br><br>

			Appearance: Red hair that's usually kept in a braid down their back, green eyes, 4'9. Angular cheekbones and jawline. They pick clothing for its usefulness rather than aesthetic, so they tend to be dressed somewhat eclectically, and frequently switch out clothing items when they find a better piece; they can almost always be seen wearing the same pair of thick black boots, however.<br><br>

			Personality: They like to take charge and lead things but this often leads to them being bossy and overbearing. They're compassionate for others, especially those weaker than them, but they can often be snappy and harsh. They're excellent at practical thinking, solutions, and planning, but not great at emotions. They like helping others, but will usually put themselves first in a "them vs me" situation. They don't enjoy fighting but they won't hesitate to take part in it if necessary. Generally curious and willing to talk to strangers, but not super friendly at first.<br><br>

			Backstory: Left home in search of work but has been unable to find it thus far, hence why they're trying to steal from the prisoners. They aren't on bad terms with their parents but they didn't enjoy living with them and therefore decided to leave to make a life of their own; they resorted to stealing rather than going home because they didn't want to admit that they had been wrong to leave. They have a brother back home whom they miss and hope to visit once they acquire a steady source of income.<br><br>

			Other: will try to make literally anything a pet. They literally show up with a pet bearded dragon named Trombone, and that's not even the weirdest pet they've ever had. Trombone is, however, the first pet they've hired a necromancer to revive. Trombone is currently living out his second life.<br>
