			Age: 45<br>
			Gender: Female<br>
			Race: Fairy<br>
			<i>Fae Element: Energy</i><br>
			Position: Eskiholti Privateer<br><br>

			Appearance: Whitish blonde hair, 1ft tall, pale skin, green and tired eyes.<br><br>

			Personality: Batshit crazy, prankster, impulsive, protective, emotionally unstable.<br><br>

			Relationships: Has a platonic relationship with Nijem as his partner in missions and crimes. Has trouble interacting with others as they don't always appreciate her madness. Once had a romantic relationship in the Feywild.<br><br>

			Backstory: Cas escaped from the Feywild when she was tortured and jailed for going against the courts that were trying to take over the land. However, travelling between realms ruined her mind and made her go mad. She now deals with heightened emotions, poor impulse control, and amnesia. As soon as she came into Remnant, she found Nijem and he rescued her. Since then she has travelled with him and robbed pirate ships until they found their own.<br>
